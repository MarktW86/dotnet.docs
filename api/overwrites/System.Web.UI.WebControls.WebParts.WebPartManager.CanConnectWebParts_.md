summary: Checks the <xref href="System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart"></xref> controls that will be participating in a connection to determine whether they are capable of being connected.
remarks: "The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.CanConnectWebParts%2A> method is used to determine whether two <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> controls can be connected. The method is typically used as a conditional check prior to calling the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.ConnectWebParts%2A> method.  \n  \n The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.CanConnectWebParts%2A> method checks a number of criteria that must be met before two controls can form a connection. The following list summarizes the primary criteria for making a connection. If all these criteria (plus some additional internal conditions) are met, the method returns `true`, meaning that the controls can be connected:  \n  \n-   The provider and consumer controls cannot be `null`, and they must be contained in the collection of controls referenced by the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.WebParts%2A> property.  \n  \n-   The provider and consumer cannot be the same control. In other words a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> control cannot connect to itself.  \n  \n-   The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.ConnectionPoint> objects (connection points) for both the provider and consumer cannot be `null`.  \n  \n-   The provider and consumer cannot be closed (neither control's <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart.IsClosed%2A> property can be `true`).  \n  \n-   The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.ConnectionPoint.ControlType%2A> property of the connection point control must match the type of the control of both consumer and provider.  \n  \n-   The connection points must both be enabled (their <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.ConnectionPoint.GetEnabled%2A> methods must both return `true`).  \n  \n-   Each connection point must not be attempting to form more connections than what is specified in its own <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.ConnectionPoint.AllowsMultipleConnections%2A> property.  \n  \n-   If a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartTransformer> object (transformer) is required to connect incompatible controls, it cannot be `null`. However, if the controls are already compatible, the transformer must be `null`.  \n  \n-   The transformer (if used) must be referenced in the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.AvailableTransformers%2A> collection.  \n  \n-   The transformer (if used) must have interfaces that are compatible with the provider and the consumer so that it can transform data between the two controls. The secondary interfaces of the consumer and provider must also be compatible."
