<p>The <xref href="System.Web.UI.Design.WebControls.RepeaterDesigner.Dispose(System.Boolean)"></xref> method can be called multiple times by other objects. When overriding it, ensure that you do not reference objects that have been disposed in an earlier call to <xref href="System.Web.UI.Design.WebControls.RepeaterDesigner.Dispose(System.Boolean)"></xref>. For more information about how to implement this method, see [Implementing a Dispose Method](~/docs/standard/garbage-collection/implementing-dispose.md). For more information about the Dispose and Finalize methods, see [Dispose Pattern](~/docs/standard/design-guidelines/dispose-pattern.md).</p>
