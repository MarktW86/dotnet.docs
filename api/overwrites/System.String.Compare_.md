summary: Compares two specified <xref href="System.String"></xref> objects and returns an integer that indicates their relative position in the sort order.
remarks: "All overloads of the <xref:System.String.Compare%2A>method return a 32-bit signed integer indicating the lexical relationship between the two comparands.  \n  \n|Value|Condition|  \n|-----------|---------------|  \n|Less than zero|The first substring precedes the second substring in the sort order.|  \n|Zero|The substrings occur in the same position in the sort order, or `length` is zero.|  \n|Greater than zero|The first substring follows the second substring in the sort order.|  \n  \n> [!WARNING]\n>  Whenever possible, you should call an overload of the <xref:System.String.Compare%2A> method that includes a <xref:System.StringComparison> parameter. For more information, see [Best Practices for Using Strings](~/docs/standard/base-types/best-practices-strings.md)."
