summary: Requests that the recognizer pauses to update its state.
remarks: "Use this method to synchronize changes to the recognizer. For example, if you load or unload a speech recognition grammar while the recognizer is processing input, use this method and the <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.SpeechRecognitionEngine.RecognizerUpdateReached> event to synchronize your application behavior with the state of the recognizer.  \n  \n When this method is called, the recognizer pauses or completes asynchronous operations and generates a <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.SpeechRecognitionEngine.RecognizerUpdateReached> event. A <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.SpeechRecognitionEngine.RecognizerUpdateReached> event handler can then modify the state of the recognizer in between recognition operations. When handling <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.SpeechRecognitionEngine.RecognizerUpdateReached> events, the recognizer pauses until the event handler returns.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  If the input to the recognizer is changed before the recognizer raises the <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.SpeechRecognitionEngine.RecognizerUpdateReached> event, the request is discarded.  \n  \n When this method is called:  \n  \n-   If the recognizer is not processing input, the recognizer immediately generates the <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.SpeechRecognitionEngine.RecognizerUpdateReached> event.  \n  \n-   If the recognizer is processing input that consists of silence or background noise, the recognizer pauses the recognition operation and generates the <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.SpeechRecognitionEngine.RecognizerUpdateReached> event.  \n  \n-   If the recognizer is processing input that does not consist of silence or background noise, the recognizer completes the recognition operation and then generates the <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.SpeechRecognitionEngine.RecognizerUpdateReached> event.  \n  \n While the recognizer is handling the <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.SpeechRecognitionEngine.RecognizerUpdateReached> event:  \n  \n-   The recognizer does not process input, and the value of the <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.SpeechRecognitionEngine.RecognizerAudioPosition%2A> property remains the same.  \n  \n-   The recognizer continues to collect input, and the value of the <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.SpeechRecognitionEngine.AudioPosition%2A> property can change."
