summary: Initializes a new instance of the <xref href="System.Windows.Media.ArcSegment"></xref> class.
remarks: "The <xref:System.Windows.Media.ArcSegment> class defines only the destination point of the arc it represents; the beginning point of the arc is the current point of the <xref:System.Windows.Media.PathFigure>, to which the <xref:System.Windows.Media.ArcSegment> is added.  \n  \n For most elliptical arcs of a particular position, size, and rotation, there are four different arcs that can be drawn; the `largeArc` and `sweepDirection` parameters indicate which arc to use.  \n  \n Of the four candidate arc sweeps, two represent large arcs with sweeps of 180 degrees or greater, and two represent smaller arcs with sweeps 180 degrees or less. If `largeArc` is **true**, then one of the two larger arc sweeps is chosen; otherwise, if `largeArc` is **false**, one of the smaller arc sweeps is chosen.  \n  \n If `sweepDirection` is <xref:System.Windows.Media.SweepDirection.Clockwise>, the arc is drawn in a positive-angle direction. If `sweepDirection` is <xref:System.Windows.Media.SweepDirection.Counterclockwise>, the arc is drawn in a negative-angle direction."
