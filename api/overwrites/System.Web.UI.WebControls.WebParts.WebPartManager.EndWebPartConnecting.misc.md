<p>Developers who need to extend the <xref href="System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager"></xref> control might want to override this method in a derived class. One approach would be to call the base method and then add some additional custom handling, or you might want to completely customize the entire process of completing a connection between controls.</p>
