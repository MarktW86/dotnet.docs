<p>This method allows implementers to define processes that must be performed after deleting all the elements from the underlying <xref href="System.Collections.Hashtable"></xref>. By defining this method, implementers can add functionality to inherited methods without having to override all other methods.  
  
 <xref href="System.Collections.DictionaryBase.OnClear"></xref> is invoked before the standard Clear behavior, whereas <xref href="System.Collections.DictionaryBase.OnClearComplete"></xref> is invoked after the standard Clear behavior.</p>
