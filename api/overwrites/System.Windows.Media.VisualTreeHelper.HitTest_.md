summary: Returns the topmost <xref href="System.Windows.Media.Visual"></xref> object of a hit test.
remarks: "The overloaded methods that take <xref:System.Windows.Media.HitTestResultCallback> and <xref:System.Windows.Media.HitTestFilterCallback> as parameters provide additional functionality during hit testing:  \n  \n-   Allow you to participate in controlling the visual tree traversal during hit testing.  \n  \n-   Allow you to retrieve all of the visuals under the point or geometry, not just the topmost one."
