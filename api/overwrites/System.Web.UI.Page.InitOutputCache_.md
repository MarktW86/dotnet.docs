remarks: "This method is not intended to be used directly from your code. To enable and manipulate output caching for a page, use one of these approaches:  \n  \n-   Set options declaratively using the  directive in the .aspx file.  \n  \n-   Use the methods and properties of the <xref:System.Web.HttpCachePolicy> class, which is exposed by the `Response.Cache` object in the page's code.  \n  \n For more information, see [Caching ASP.NET Pages](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/e9666a1b-88df-4931-af0b-a754fc65660b)."
