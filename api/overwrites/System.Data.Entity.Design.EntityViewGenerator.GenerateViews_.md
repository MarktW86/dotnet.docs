summary: Generates views at compile time for the extents in a <xref href="System.Data.Mapping.StorageMappingItemCollection"></xref>, and creates a source code file that makes these views available at run time.
remarks: By default, views are generated at run time whenever a query or update is performed on an extent. Generating views at compile time can improve application performance by eliminating the expense of generating views at run time.
