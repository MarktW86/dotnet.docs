<p>Override this method when customizing the <xref href="System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView"></xref> control and modifying how and when the current cell changes. For example, if you create a custom row type that merges multiple cells into single cells and you modify the navigation accordingly, you can override this method to provide accessibility support for your changes.</p>
