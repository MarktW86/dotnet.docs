summary: Initializes a new instance of the <xref href="System.Data.Objects.ObjectQuery`1"></xref> class.
remarks: "An <xref:System.Data.Objects.ObjectQuery%601> can be initialized in such a way that it represents a single scalar result and not a collection of scalar results. Some extension methods require collection results as input. In this case, an <xref:System.ArgumentException> is thrown when one of these methods is called. For more information, see [Object Queries](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/0768033c-876f-471d-85d5-264884349276).  \n  \n When your application generates Entity SQL queries at runtime, you should be aware of any command length limitations of the data source. Entity SQL does not enforce limitations on the length of the command text in queries."
