summary: Returns a collection of elements that contains the descendant elements of every element and document in the source collection.
remarks: "Visual Basic users can use the integrated XML descendant axis to retrieve the descendant elements of a collection. However, the integrated axis only retrieves descendants with a specified name. If Visual Basic users want to retrieve all descendants, then they must use this axis method explicitly.  \n  \n This method uses deferred execution."
