summary: Inserts a new print job into the queue.
remarks: "Unless the queue is paused or in an error state, the job prints when it reaches the top of the queue, so this is a printing function.  \n  \n Other ways to print in [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_winclient](~/includes/tlasharptla-winclient-md.md)] include the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.PrintDialog.PrintDocument%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method, which can be used with or without opening the dialog, and the many <xref:System.Windows.Xps.XpsDocumentWriter.Write%2A> and <xref:System.Windows.Xps.XpsDocumentWriter.WriteAsync%2A> methods of the <xref:System.Windows.Xps.XpsDocumentWriter>."
