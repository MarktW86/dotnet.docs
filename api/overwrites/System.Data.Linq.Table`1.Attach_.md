summary: Attaches an entity to the <xref href="System.Data.Linq.DataContext"></xref>.
remarks: "Use the `Attach` methods with entities that have been created in one <xref:System.Data.Linq.DataContext>, serialized to a client, and then deserialized back (with the intention to perform an update or delete operation). For more information, see [Data Retrieval and CUD Operations in N-Tier Applications (LINQ to SQL)](~/docs/framework/data/adonet/sql/linq/data-retrieval-and-cud-operations-in-n-tier-applications.md).  \n  \n Do not try to `Attach` an entity that has not been detached through serialization. Entities that have not been serialized still maintain associations with deferred loaders that can cause unexpected results if the entity becomes tracked by a second data context.  \n  \n When a new entity is attached, deferred loaders for any child collections (for example, `EntitySet` collections of entities from associated tables) are initialized. When <xref:System.Data.Linq.DataContext.SubmitChanges%2A> is called, members of the child collections are put into an `Unmodified` state. To update members of a child collection, you must explicitly call `Attach` and specify that entity.  \n  \n `Attach` attaches all entities in the object graph of the provided object. For example, the following C# code:  \n  \n```  \nusing (SampleDataContext db = new SampleDataContext()) {  \n    Employee employee = new Employee { employeeId = 1 };  \n  \n    Master master = new Master();  \n    master.Employee = employee;  \n  \n    Child child = new Child();  \n    child.Employee = employee;  \n  \n    db.Employees.Attach(employee);  \n  \n    master.Child = child;  \n  \n    db.Masters.InsertOnSubmit(master);  \n  \n    db.SubmitChanges();  \n}  \n  \n```  \n  \n The equivalent Visual Basic code is:  \n  \n```  \nUsing db As New SampleDataContext()    Dim employee As New Employee With { .employeeId = 1 }  \n  \n    Dim master As New Master()  \n    master.Employee = employee  \n  \n    Dim child As New Child()  \n    child.Employee = employee  \n  \n    db.Employees.Attach(employee)  \n  \n    master.Child = child  \n  \n    db.Masters.InsertOnSubmit(master)  \n  \n    db.SubmitChanges()  \n  \nEnd Using  \n```  \n  \n Calling `Attach` on `Employee` attaches employee, master, and child, because the `Employee` has relationships to both master and child. You must explicitly call `InsertOnSubmit` to change the state from attached to inserted."
