summary: Determines whether a message or XML document satisfies the query criteria of the XPath filter.
remarks: "These methods check one filter against a message. If you need to check the message against multiple filters, put the filters into a filter table and then use the match methods provided by the table.  \n  \n If you only need to test the message headers and not the message body, use the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Dispatcher.XPathMessageFilter.Match%2A> method.  \n  \n If you need to test parts of the message body, use the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Dispatcher.XPathMessageFilter.Match%2A> method.  \n  \n For tests that involve XPath queries, use one of the remaining overloads of the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Dispatcher.XPathMessageFilter.Match%2A>."
