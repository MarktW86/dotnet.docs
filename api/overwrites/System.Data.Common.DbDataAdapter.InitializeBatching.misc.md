<p>This method is protected and is designed for use by a .NET Framework data provider.  
  
 If a class that inherits from <xref href="System.Data.Common.DbDataAdapter"></xref> supports batches, that class overrides this method. This method gives the class the opportunity to initialize any resources necessary to support batching. For example, a class may allocate a data structure to hold the set of commands in the batch.</p>
