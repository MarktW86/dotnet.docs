summary: Adds a property or pattern identifier to a <xref href="System.Windows.Automation.CacheRequest"></xref>.
remarks: "When a <xref:System.Windows.Automation.CacheRequest> object is created, the <xref:System.Windows.Automation.AutomationElement.RuntimeIdProperty> identifier is added as a default property to cache.  \n  \n Adding an object that is already in the cache request has no effect."
uid: System.Windows.Automation.CacheRequest.Add*
