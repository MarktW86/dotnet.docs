<p>Although you can call the <xref href="System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.LayoutEditorPart.SyncChanges"></xref> method from your code, it is not necessary to do so. The Web Parts control set calls this method and the <xref href="System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.LayoutEditorPart.ApplyChanges"></xref> method at the proper times in the editing process to keep editing controls synchronized with their associated <xref href="System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart"></xref> controls.</p>
