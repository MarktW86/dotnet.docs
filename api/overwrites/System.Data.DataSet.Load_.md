summary: Fills a <xref href="System.Data.DataSet"></xref> with values from a data source using the supplied <xref href="System.Data.IDataReader"></xref>.
remarks: "The <xref:System.Data.DataTable.Load%2A> method provides a technique for filling a single <xref:System.Data.DataTable> with data, retrieved from an <xref:System.Data.IDataReader> instance. This method provides the same functionality, but allows you to load multiple result sets from an `IDataReader` into multiple tables within a `DataSet`.  \n  \n If the `DataSet` already contains rows, the incoming data from the data source is merged with the existing rows.  \n  \n The `Load` method can be used in several common scenarios, all centered around getting data from a specified data source and adding it to the current data container (in this case, a `DataSet`). These scenarios describe standard usage for a `DataSet`, describing its update and merge behavior.  \n  \n A `DataSet` synchronizes or updates with a single primary data source. The `DataSet` tracks changes, allowing synchronization with the primary data source. In addition, a `DataSet` can accept incremental data from one or more secondary data sources. The `DataSet` isn't responsible for tracking changes in order to allow synchronization with the secondary data source.  \n  \n Given these two hypothetical data sources, a user is likely to require one of the following behaviors:  \n  \n-   Initialize `DataSet` from a primary data source. In this scenario, the user wants to initialize an empty `DataSet` with values from the primary data source. One or more DataTable's contents are modified. Later the user intends to propagate changes back to the primary data source.  \n  \n-   Preserve changes and re-synchronize from the primary data source. In this scenario, the user wants to take the `DataSet` filled in the previous scenario and perform an incremental synchronization with the primary data source, preserving modifications made in the `DataSet`.  \n  \n-   Incremental data feed from secondary data sources. In this scenario, the user wants to merge changes from one or more secondary data sources, and propagate those changes back to the primary data source.  \n  \n The `Load` method makes all these scenarios possible. This method allows you to specify a load option parameter, indicating how rows already in a <xref:System.Data.DataTable> combine with rows being loaded. The following table describes the three load options provided by the <xref:System.Data.LoadOption> enumeration. In each case, the description indicates the behavior when the primary key of a row in the incoming data matches the primary key of an existing row.  \n  \n|Load Option|Description|  \n|-----------------|-----------------|  \n|`PreserveChanges` (default)|Updates the original version of the row with the value of the incoming row.|  \n|`OverwriteChanges`|Updates the current and original versions of the row with the value of the incoming row.|  \n|`Upsert`|Updates the current version of the row with the value of the incoming row.|  \n  \n In general, the `PreserveChanges` and `OverwriteChanges` options are intended for scenarios in which the user needs to synchronize the `DataSet` and its changes with the primary data source. The `Upsert` option facilitates aggregating changes from one or more secondary data sources."
