summary: Derives the key material that is generated from the secret agreement between two parties.
remarks: The Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) algorithm accepts the private key and the other partyâ€™s public key as input, and produces the secret agreement as output. The key derivation function (KDF) then takes the secret agreement and produces the key material as output.
