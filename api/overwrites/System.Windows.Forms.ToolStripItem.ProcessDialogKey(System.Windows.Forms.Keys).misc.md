<p>When overriding the <xref href="System.Windows.Forms.ToolStripItem.ProcessDialogKey(System.Windows.Forms.Keys)"></xref> method in a derived class, the overriding implementation should return `true` to indicate that it has processed the key. Derived classes will seldom, if ever, need to override this method.</p>
