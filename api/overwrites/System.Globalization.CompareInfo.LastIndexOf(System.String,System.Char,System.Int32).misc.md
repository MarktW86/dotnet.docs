<p>Character sets include ignorable characters, which are characters that are not considered when performing a linguistic or culture-sensitive sort. In a culture-sensitive search, if <code>value</code> is an ignorable character, the result is equivalent to searching with that character removed. In this case, the <xref href="System.Globalization.CompareInfo.LastIndexOf(System.String,System.Char,System.Int32)"></xref> method always returns <code>startIndex</code>, which is the character position at which the search begins. In the following example, the <xref href="System.Globalization.CompareInfo.LastIndexOf(System.String,System.Char,System.Int32)"></xref> method is used to find a soft hyphen (U+00AD) that precedes the final "m‚Äù in two strings. Only one of the strings contains a soft hyphen. In both cases, because the soft hyphen is an ignorable character, the method returns the index position of the "m", which is the value of <code>startIndex</code>.
