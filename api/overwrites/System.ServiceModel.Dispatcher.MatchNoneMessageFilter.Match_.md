summary: These methods returns `false` for every message that is not `null`.
remarks: The difference between the two overloads of the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Dispatcher.MatchNoneMessageFilter.Match%2A> method is that one takes the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.MessageBuffer> parameter and buffers the entire contents of a message (including its body) into memory, while the other takes the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.Message> parameter and does not buffer the body.
uid: System.ServiceModel.Dispatcher.MatchNoneMessageFilter.Match*
