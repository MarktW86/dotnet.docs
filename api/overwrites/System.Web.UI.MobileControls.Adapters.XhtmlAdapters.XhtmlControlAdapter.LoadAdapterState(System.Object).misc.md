<p>The base implementation of <xref href="System.Web.UI.MobileControls.Adapters.XhtmlAdapters.XhtmlControlAdapter.LoadAdapterState(System.Object)"></xref> loads the current secondary UI mode from view state. You can override it to load other specific data from view state, but be sure to also invoke the base method in order to preserve the secondary UI mode across requests. For more information on managing view state, see [ASP.NET State Management Overview](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/0218d965-5d30-445b-b6a6-8870e70e63ce).</p>
