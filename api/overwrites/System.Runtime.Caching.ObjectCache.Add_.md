summary: When overridden in a derived class, inserts a cache entry into the cache, without requiring that an existing cache entry with a matching key be returned.
remarks: "The <xref:System.Runtime.Caching.ObjectCache.Add%2A> method overloads try to insert a cache entry into the cache, without overwriting or removing an existing cache entry that has the same key. The cache entry can be a typed <xref:System.Runtime.Caching.CacheItem> object or a generic object.  \n  \n The <xref:System.Runtime.Caching.ObjectCache.AddOrGetExisting%2A> method overloads and the <xref:System.Runtime.Caching.ObjectCache.Add%2A> method overloads have one significant difference. When these methods insert a cache entry, if a matching entry is found in the cache, the <xref:System.Runtime.Caching.ObjectCache.AddOrGetExisting%2A> method overloads return the existing cache entry, but the <xref:System.Runtime.Caching.ObjectCache.Add%2A> method overloads do not. Having these different method overloads enables callers to optimize their code based on whether they need the existing cache entry. In distributed caches, returning an existing value by using the <xref:System.Runtime.Caching.ObjectCache.AddOrGetExisting%2A> method might be more expensive than returning a Boolean value by using <xref:System.Runtime.Caching.ObjectCache.Add%2A> method."
