<p>This method times out after an interval that is equal to the default time-out value of the application domain in which it is called. If a time-out value has not been defined for the application domain, the value <xref href="System.Text.RegularExpressions.Regex.InfiniteMatchTimeout"></xref>, which prevents the method from timing out, is used. The recommended static method for retrieving a pattern match is <xref href="System.Text.RegularExpressions.Regex.Match(System.String,System.String)"></xref>, which lets you set the time-out interval.</p>
