<p>When overriding <xref href="System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewRow.Clone"></xref> in a derived class, call the base class's <xref href="System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewRow.Clone"></xref> method so that the properties of the base class are copied to the new row, and be sure to also copy the values of any properties that were added to the derived class.</p>
