summary: Initializes a new instance of the <xref href="System.Speech.Recognition.Grammar"></xref> class.
remarks: "You can use a <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.Grammar.%23ctor%2A> constructor to create a <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.Grammar> instance from a <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.GrammarBuilder> or <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.SrgsGrammar.SrgsDocument> object, or from a file or a <xref:System.IO.Stream> that contains a description of a grammar in a supported format. Supported formats include the following:  \n  \n-   XML-format files that conform to the W3C [Speech Recognition Grammar Specification (SRGS) Version 1.0](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=201761)  \n  \n-   Grammars that have been compiled to a binary file with a .cfg file extension  \n  \n Grammar constructors that accept XML-format grammar files in their arguments compile the XML grammars to a binary format to optimize them for loading and consumption by a speech recognition engine. You can reduce the amount of time required to construct a <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.Grammar> object from an XML-format grammar by compiling the grammar in advance, using one of the <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.SrgsGrammar.SrgsGrammarCompiler.Compile%2A> methods.  \n  \n A speech recognition grammar can define a root rule. To create a <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.Grammar> object that specifies which rule to use as its root rule, use a constructor that accepts the `ruleName` parameter.  \n  \n To create a <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.Grammar> object that specifies a base URI to resolve relative rule references, use a constructor that takes the `baseUri` parameter."
