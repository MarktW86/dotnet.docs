summary: Writes the address header to a stream or file.
remarks: The <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.AddressHeader.WriteAddressHeader%2A> and <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.AddressHeader.WriteAddressHeader%28System.Xml.XmlWriter%29> overloads provide interfaces to use in writing an address header to a stream or file. Both call the abstract <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.AddressHeader.OnWriteAddressHeaderContents%28System.Xml.XmlDictionaryWriter%29> method, so users must provide an implementation of this method to use these overloads.
