summary: Appends a grammar file or a grammar rule to the current sequence of grammar elements.
remarks: "The <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.GrammarBuilder.AppendRuleReference%2A> methods can append a grammar file or a grammar rule from a file. These methods allow applications to make use of pre-deployed or publicly available grammar rules. The application must have read access to the location of specified grammar files.  \n  \n These methods can read a speech recognition grammar from the following formats.  \n  \n-   XML-format files that conform to the W3C [Speech Recognition Grammar Specification (SRGS) Version 1.0](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=201761)  \n  \n-   Binary files that conform to the Microsoft Speech Recognition Grammar Binary Format (.cfg file extension)  \n  \n Compiling an XML-format SRGS grammar file to a binary grammar file with the .cfg extension can reduce the time consumed by searches for a match, especially if the grammar requires recognition of a large number of words and phrases. For information about compiling SRGS grammars to the CFG binary format, see <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.SrgsGrammar.SrgsGrammarCompiler>."
