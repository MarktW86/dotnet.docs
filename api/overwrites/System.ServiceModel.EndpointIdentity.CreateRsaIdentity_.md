summary: Creates an RSA identity.
remarks: "A secure [!INCLUDE[indigo2](~/includes/indigo2-md.md)] client that connects to an endpoint with this identity verifies that the claims presented by the server contain a claim that contains the RSA public key used to construct this identity.  \n  \n One of these static methods creates an instance of <xref:System.ServiceModel.RsaEndpointIdentity> by calling its constructor <xref:System.ServiceModel.RsaEndpointIdentity.%23ctor%2A>."
