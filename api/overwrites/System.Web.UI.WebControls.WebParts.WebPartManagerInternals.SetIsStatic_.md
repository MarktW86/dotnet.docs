summary: Sets the <xref href="System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart.IsStatic"></xref> property of a <xref href="System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart"></xref> control or the <xref href="System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartConnection.IsStatic"></xref> property of a <xref href="System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartConnection"></xref> object.
remarks: "The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManagerInternals.SetIsStatic%2A> method calls a method in a base class to set a property that indicates whether a particular instance of a control is static. In the Web Parts control set, a static control is a control that is declared in the markup of a Web page. This is in contrast to a dynamic control, which is either added to a page programmatically, or added by a user from a catalog of controls. A static control is inherently a shared control, meaning that it is visible to all users of a page, and although users can close a static control, they can never delete (permanently remove) it.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  For more on personalization, static versus dynamic controls, and shared versus per-user controls, see [Web Parts Personalization Overview](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/7dc34f74-52aa-4082-b98d-2bcf9e07e320)."
