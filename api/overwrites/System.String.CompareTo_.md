summary: Compares this instance with a specified object or <xref href="System.String"></xref> and returns an integer that indicates whether this instance precedes, follows, or appears in the same position in the sort order as the specified object or <xref href="System.String"></xref>.
remarks: Both overloads of the<xref:System.String.CompareTo%2A> method perform culture-sensitive and case-sensitive comparison. You cannot use this method to perform culture-insensitive or ordinal comparisons. For code clarity, we recommend that you avoid the <xref:System.String.CompareTo%2A> method and call the <xref:System.String.Compare%2A> method instead.
