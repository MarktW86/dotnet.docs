summary: Compiles the style sheet.
remarks: "Although the overall performance of the <xref:System.Xml.Xsl.XslCompiledTransform> class is better than the <xref:System.Xml.Xsl.XslTransform> class, the <xref:System.Xml.Xsl.XslCompiledTransform.Load%2A> method of the <xref:System.Xml.Xsl.XslCompiledTransform> class might perform more slowly than the <xref:System.Xml.Xsl.XslTransform.Load%2A> method of the <xref:System.Xml.Xsl.XslTransform> class the first time it is called on a transformation. This is because the XSLT file must be compiled before it is loaded. For more information, see the following blog post: [XslCompiledTransform Slower than XslTransform?](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=130590)  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  There are differences between XSLT compiled in Debug mode and XSLT compiled in Release mode. In some situations, style sheets compiled in Debug mode will not throw errors during <xref:System.Xml.Xsl.XslCompiledTransform.Load%2A>, but will later fail during <xref:System.Xml.Xsl.XslCompiledTransform.Transform%2A>. The same style sheet compiled in Release mode will fail during <xref:System.Xml.Xsl.XslCompiledTransform.Load%2A>. An example of such behavior is when a variable that is not of a node-set type is assigned to an expression where a node-set is required."
