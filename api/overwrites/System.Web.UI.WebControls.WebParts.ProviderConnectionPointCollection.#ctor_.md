summary: Initializes a new instance of the <xref href="System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.ProviderConnectionPointCollection"></xref> class.
remarks: It is possible to create a new instance of the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.ProviderConnectionPointCollection> class directly from your code, but because the class inherits from the <xref:System.Collections.ReadOnlyCollectionBase> class, your new collection is read-only and you cannot add or remove members after you have created it.
uid: System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.ProviderConnectionPointCollection.#ctor*
