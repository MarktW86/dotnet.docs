summary: Encodes a string.
remarks: "This method encodes strings. For instance, single quotation marks and double quotation marks are included as `\\'` and `\\\"` in the encoded string.  \n  \n URL encoding makes sure that all browsers correctly transmit text in URL strings. Characters such as a question mark (?), ampersand (&), slash (/), and spaces might be truncated or corrupted by some browsers. Therefore, these characters must be encoded in `a` elements or in query strings where the strings can be re-sent by a browser in a request string."
