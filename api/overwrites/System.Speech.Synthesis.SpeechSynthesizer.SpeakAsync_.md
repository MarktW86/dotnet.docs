summary: Generates speech output asynchronously from a string, a <xref href="System.Speech.Synthesis.Prompt"></xref> object, or a <xref href="System.Speech.Synthesis.PromptBuilder"></xref> object.
remarks: "The <xref:System.Speech.Synthesis.SpeechSynthesizer.SpeakAsync%2A> methods generate speech asynchronously. The methods return immediately without waiting for the content of the <xref:System.Speech.Synthesis.SpeechSynthesizer.SpeakAsync%2A> object to finish speaking. Use <xref:System.Speech.Synthesis.SpeechSynthesizer.SpeakAsync%2A> if your application needs to perform tasks while speaking, for example highlight text, paint animation, monitor controls, or other tasks.  \n  \n During a call to this method, the <xref:System.Speech.Synthesis.SpeechSynthesizer> can raise the following events:  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Speech.Synthesis.SpeechSynthesizer.StateChanged>. Raised when the speaking state of the synthesizer changes.  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Speech.Synthesis.SpeechSynthesizer.SpeakStarted>. Raised when the synthesizer begins generating speech.  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Speech.Synthesis.SpeechSynthesizer.PhonemeReached>. Raised each time the synthesizer reaches a letter or combination of letters that constitute a discreet sound of speech in a language.  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Speech.Synthesis.SpeechSynthesizer.SpeakProgress>. Raised each time the synthesizer completes speaking a word.  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Speech.Synthesis.SpeechSynthesizer.VisemeReached>. Raised each time spoken output requires a change in the position of the mouth or the facial muscles used to produce speech.  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Speech.Synthesis.SpeechSynthesizer.BookmarkReached>. Raised when the synthesizer encounters a bookmark in a prompt.  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Speech.Synthesis.SpeechSynthesizer.VoiceChange>. Raised when the speaking voice for the synthesizer changes.  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Speech.Synthesis.SpeechSynthesizer.SpeakCompleted>. Raised when the synthesizer finishes a <xref:System.Speech.Synthesis.SpeechSynthesizer.SpeakAsync%2A> operation.  \n  \n If your application does not need to perform tasks while speaking, you can use the <xref:System.Speech.Synthesis.SpeechSynthesizer.Speak%2A> methods or the <xref:System.Speech.Synthesis.SpeechSynthesizer.SpeakSsml%2A> method to generate speech synchronously."
