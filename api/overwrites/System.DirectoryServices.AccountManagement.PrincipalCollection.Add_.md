summary: Adds the specified principal to the end of the collection.
remarks: As with <xref:System.DirectoryServices.AccountManagement.PrincipalCollection.Remove%2A> and <xref:System.DirectoryServices.AccountManagement.PrincipalCollection.Contains%2A>, There are four overloads to this function, but they all do the same thing.  The extra overloads are only implemented to improve usability, so that developers using Intellisense see overloads that take a <xref:System.DirectoryServices.AccountManagement.UserPrincipal>, <xref:System.DirectoryServices.AccountManagement.GroupPrincipal>, or <xref:System.DirectoryServices.AccountManagement.ComputerPrincipal> object.  Calling any one of the User, Group, or Computer overloads is exactly equivalent to calling the <xref:System.DirectoryServices.AccountManagement.Principal> overload.
