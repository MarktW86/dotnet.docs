summary: Begins an asynchronous operation to accept a channel within a specified or default interval of time.
remarks: It is recommended that the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.IChannelListener%601.BeginAcceptChannel%2A> overload with the explicit timeout be used. The `timeout` specified for that method overrides any default timeouts set by the system for the service.
