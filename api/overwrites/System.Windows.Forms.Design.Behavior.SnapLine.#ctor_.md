summary: Initializes a new instance of the <xref href="System.Windows.Forms.Design.Behavior.SnapLine"></xref> class.
remarks: You should only explicitly create snaplines to replace or supplement the default snapline behavior offered by the visual designer. To create a snapline, you should instance a snapline and then add it to the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Design.ControlDesigner.SnapLines%2A> property of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Design.ControlDesigner> class.
