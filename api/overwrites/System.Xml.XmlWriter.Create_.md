summary: Creates a new <xref href="System.Xml.XmlWriter"></xref> instance.
remarks: "Some of the <xref:System.Xml.XmlWriter.Create%2A> overloads include a `settings` parameter that accepts an <xref:System.Xml.XmlWriterSettings> object. You can use this object to:  \n  \n-   Specify which features you want supported on the created <xref:System.Xml.XmlWriter> object.  \n  \n-   Reuse the <xref:System.Xml.XmlWriterSettings> object to create multiple writer objects. The <xref:System.Xml.XmlWriterSettings> object is copied and marked read-only for each created writer. Changes to the settings on an <xref:System.Xml.XmlWriterSettings> instance do not affect existing writers with the same settings. Thus, you can use the same settings to create multiple writers with the same functionality. Or, you can modify the settings on an <xref:System.Xml.XmlWriterSettings> instance and create a new writer with a different set of features.  \n  \n-   Add features to an existing XML writer. The <xref:System.Xml.XmlWriter.Create%2A> method can accept another <xref:System.Xml.XmlWriter> object. The underlying <xref:System.Xml.XmlWriter> object does not have to be an XML writer created by the static <xref:System.Xml.XmlWriter.Create%2A> method. For example, you can specify a user-defined XML writer to add additional features to.  \n  \n-   Take full advantage of features such as better conformance checking and compliance to the [XML 1.0 recommendation](http://www.w3.org/TR/2006/REC-xml-20060816/) that are available only on <xref:System.Xml.XmlWriter> objects created by the static <xref:System.Xml.XmlWriter.Create%2A> method.  \n  \n If you use a <xref:System.Xml.XmlWriter.Create%2A> overload that doesn't accept an <xref:System.Xml.XmlWriterSettings> object, the following default writer settings are used:  \n  \n|Setting|Default|  \n|-------------|-------------|  \n|<xref:System.Xml.XmlWriterSettings.CheckCharacters%2A>|`true`|  \n|<xref:System.Xml.XmlWriterSettings.CloseOutput%2A>|`false`|  \n|<xref:System.Xml.XmlWriterSettings.ConformanceLevel%2A>|<xref:System.Xml.ConformanceLevel?displayProperty=fullName>|  \n|<xref:System.Xml.XmlWriterSettings.Encoding%2A>|<xref:System.Text.Encoding.UTF8?displayProperty=fullName>|  \n|<xref:System.Xml.XmlWriterSettings.Indent%2A>|`false`|  \n|<xref:System.Xml.XmlWriterSettings.IndentChars%2A>|Two spaces|  \n|<xref:System.Xml.XmlWriterSettings.NamespaceHandling%2A>|<xref:System.Xml.NamespaceHandling.Default> (no removal)|  \n|<xref:System.Xml.XmlWriterSettings.NewLineChars%2A>|`\\r\\n` (carriage return, new line)|  \n|<xref:System.Xml.XmlWriterSettings.NewLineHandling%2A>|<xref:System.Xml.NewLineHandling?displayProperty=fullName>|  \n|<xref:System.Xml.XmlWriterSettings.NewLineOnAttributes%2A>|`false`|  \n|<xref:System.Xml.XmlWriterSettings.OmitXmlDeclaration%2A>|`false`|  \n|<xref:System.Xml.XmlWriterSettings.OutputMethod%2A>|<xref:System.Xml.XmlOutputMethod?displayProperty=fullName>|  \n|<xref:System.Xml.XmlWriterSettings.WriteEndDocumentOnClose%2A>|`true`|  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  Although the .NET Framework includes the <xref:System.Xml.XmlTextWriter> class, which is a concrete implementation of the <xref:System.Xml.XmlWriter> class, we recommend that you create <xref:System.Xml.XmlWriter> instances by using the <xref:System.Xml.XmlWriter.Create%2A> method."
