<p>Not all objects need to support this property. Typically, this property contains ToolTip style information that is used either to describe what the object does or how to use it. For example, the <xref href="System.Windows.Forms.AccessibleObject.Help"></xref> property for a toolbar button that shows a printer might be "Prints the current document." The text for the <xref href="System.Windows.Forms.AccessibleObject.Help"></xref> property does not have to be unique within the user interface. Servers do not need to support the <xref href="System.Windows.Forms.AccessibleObject.Help"></xref> property if other properties provide sufficient information about the object's purpose and what actions the object might perform.</p>
