summary: Returns a value that indicates whether the match criterion of exactly one <xref href="System.ServiceModel.Dispatcher.MessageFilter"></xref> in the table is satisfied by the specified message or buffered message and adds the matching filter data to a collection.
remarks: "Use one of these methods when a single filter is expected to match the message and only the `FilterData` from the matching filter must be recovered.  \n  \n Use <xref:System.ServiceModel.Dispatcher.MessageFilterTable%601.GetMatchingValue%2A> to inspect message headers and <xref:System.ServiceModel.Dispatcher.MessageFilterTable%601.GetMatchingValue%2A> to inspect a buffered message, which can include looking at the message body."
