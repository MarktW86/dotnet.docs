summary: Starts a synchronous speech recognition operation.
remarks: "These methods perform a single, synchronous recognition operation. The recognizer performs this operation against its loaded and enabled speech recognition grammars.  \n  \n During a call to this method, the recognizer can raise the following events:  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.SpeechRecognitionEngine.SpeechDetected>.  Raised when the recognizer detects input that it can identify as speech.  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.SpeechRecognitionEngine.SpeechHypothesized>.  Raised when input creates an ambiguous match with one of the active grammars.  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.SpeechRecognitionEngine.SpeechRecognitionRejected> or <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.SpeechRecognitionEngine.SpeechRecognized>. Raised when the recognizer finalizes a recognition operation.  \n  \n The recognizer does not raise the <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.SpeechRecognitionEngine.RecognizeCompleted> event when using one of the <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.SpeechRecognitionEngine.Recognize%2A> methods.  \n  \n The <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.SpeechRecognitionEngine.Recognize%2A> methods return a <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.RecognitionResult> object, or `null` if the operation is not successful or the recognizer is not enabled.  \n  \n A synchronous recognition operation can fail for the following reasons:  \n  \n-   Speech is not detected before the timeout intervals expire for the <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.SpeechRecognitionEngine.BabbleTimeout%2A> or <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.SpeechRecognitionEngine.InitialSilenceTimeout%2A> properties, or for the `initialSilenceTimeout` parameter of the <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.SpeechRecognitionEngine.Recognize%2A> method.  \n  \n-   The recognition engine detects speech but finds no matches in any of its loaded and enabled <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.Grammar> objects.  \n  \n To modify how the recognizer handles the timing of speech or silence with respect to recognition, use the <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.SpeechRecognitionEngine.BabbleTimeout%2A>, <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.SpeechRecognitionEngine.InitialSilenceTimeout%2A>, <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.SpeechRecognitionEngine.EndSilenceTimeout%2A>, and <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.SpeechRecognitionEngine.EndSilenceTimeoutAmbiguous%2A> properties.  \n  \n The <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.SpeechRecognitionEngine> must have at least one <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.Grammar> object loaded before performing recognition. To load a speech recognition grammar, use the <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.SpeechRecognitionEngine.LoadGrammar%2A> or <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.SpeechRecognitionEngine.LoadGrammarAsync%2A> method.  \n  \n To perform asynchronous recognition, use one of the <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.SpeechRecognitionEngine.RecognizeAsync%2A> methods."
