summary: Resolves a <xref href="System.Net.PeerToPeer.PeerName"></xref> object to a <xref href="System.Net.PeerToPeer.PeerNameRecord"></xref> using the PNRP protocol.
remarks: "This method associates peer names to clouds. Calling the <xref:System.Net.PeerToPeer.PeerNameResolver> method is similar to calling the <xref:System.Net.PeerToPeer.PeerNameResolver.Resolve%2A> method for each peer name record in the <xref:System.Net.PeerToPeer.PeerNameRecordCollection>. Note that using the Resolve method on an individual peer name record does not invalidate resolving multiple peer names.  \n  \n For every <xref:System.Net.PeerToPeer.PeerNameResolver.Resolve%2A> method, there is an equivalent <xref:System.Net.PeerToPeer.PeerNameResolver.ResolveAsync%2A> method.  They are identical in the parameters they are passed, except that the ResolveAsync method includes a system token in its parameter list for asynchronous event handling.  \n  \n If the <xref:System.Net.PeerToPeer.Cloud> parameter is not supplied, the method uses the <xref:System.Net.PeerToPeer.Cloud.Available> shortcut to fill in cloud parameters.  If the `maxRecords` parameter is missing, the default value of zero causes an <xref:System.ArgumentOutOfRangeException> exception to be thrown.  \n  \n This event will also be raised if the resolve operation completes in error or is canceled."
