summary: Creates a connection between two <xref href="System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart"></xref> controls (or other server controls capable of forming connections) that reside in a <xref href="System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZoneBase"></xref> zone.
remarks: "The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.ConnectWebParts%2A> method forms a connection between any two <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> controls that can be connected. Before calling this method to create a connection, you might also want to call the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.CanConnectWebParts%2A> method in a conditional check to ensure that the controls meet the requirements for forming a connection.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  It is also possible to create a connection between two server controls that are not <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> controls. In general, the two controls would have to be custom server controls (for example, controls that inherit from <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebControl> or existing ASP.NET server controls) so that you could add the required members. The controls would also have to meet the requirements specified below.  \n  \n Any type of connection scenario between two controls must meet the following requirements to be able to connect:  \n  \n-   Each control resides in a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZoneBase> zone (it does not have to be the same zone).  \n  \n-   As implemented in the Web Parts control set, the provider control in a connection implements an interface as a public method that serves as a callback to the provider, and has a `ConnectionProvider` metadata attribute on the method to identify it as a provider connection point. Because the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.GetProviderConnectionPoints%2A> method that retrieves provider connection points is virtual, a derived <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager> control does not necessarily have to use the same metadata attribute.  \n  \n-   As implemented in the Web Parts control set, the consumer control in a connection also has a special method that enables it to get a reference to the interface that is exposed in the provider's callback method, and the consumer has a `ConnectionConsumer` metadata attribute on the method to identify it as a consumer connection point. Because the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.GetConsumerConnectionPoints%2A> method that retrieves consumer connection points is virtual, a derived <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager> control does not necessarily have to use the same metadata attribute.  \n  \n-   The callback methods must either be compatible, in that the consumer can use the type of interface supplied in the provider's callback method (meaning that the consumer and provider can share data directly), or the developer must use a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartTransformer> object to transform the data from the provider into a form that the consumer can use.  \n  \n    > [!IMPORTANT]\n    >  When you do not need a transformer, use the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.ConnectWebParts%28System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart%2CSystem.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.ProviderConnectionPoint%2CSystem.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart%2CSystem.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.ConsumerConnectionPoint%29> method overload. When you need a transformer, use the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.ConnectWebParts%28System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart%2CSystem.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.ProviderConnectionPoint%2CSystem.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart%2CSystem.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.ConsumerConnectionPoint%2CSystem.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartTransformer%29> method overload."
