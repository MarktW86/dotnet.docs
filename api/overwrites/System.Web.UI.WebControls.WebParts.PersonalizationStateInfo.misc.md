<p>When you inherit from <xref href="System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.PersonalizationStateInfo"></xref>, there are no abstract members that you must override. Note that the class is abstract but none of the class members are abstract. This class is currently used internally by the .NET Framework and the constructor for this class is internal, so derived versions of this class have no way to initialize the <code>path</code>, <code>lastUpdatedDate</code> and <code>size</code> parameters required for the constructor.</p>
