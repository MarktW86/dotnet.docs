<p>Only one thumbnail image can represent the document as a whole (although individual pages can have their own thumbnail images).  An <xref href="System.InvalidOperationException"></xref> is thrown if <xref href="System.Windows.Xps.Packaging.IXpsFixedDocumentWriter.AddThumbnail(System.Windows.Xps.Packaging.XpsImageType)"></xref> is called when the document already has a thumbnail.</p>
