<p>When overriding the <xref href="System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewCell.Clone"></xref> method in a derived class, call the base class's <xref href="System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewCell.Clone"></xref> method so that the properties of the base class are copied to the new cell, and be sure to also copy the values of any properties that were added to the derived class.</p>
