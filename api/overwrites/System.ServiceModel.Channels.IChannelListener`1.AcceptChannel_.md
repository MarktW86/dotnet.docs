summary: Accepts a channel of a specified type for communication with a client.
remarks: It is recommended that the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.IChannelListener%601.AcceptChannel%28System.TimeSpan%29> overload with the explicit timeout be used. The `timeout` specified for that method overrides any default timeouts set by the system for the service.
