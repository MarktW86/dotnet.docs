<p>Changing the reported source of an event programmatically can potentially require updating the type-specific data within the event. For this reason, the <xref href="System.Windows.RoutedEventArgs.OnSetSource(System.Object)"></xref> method is protected virtual and is intended to be overridden by subclasses of <xref href="System.Windows.RoutedEventArgs"></xref>.  
  
 This method has no default implementation.</p>
