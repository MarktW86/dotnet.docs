<p>If you want to create a custom <xref href="System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorZone"></xref> zone to gain greater control over the rendering of the editing UI, you can inherit directly from the <xref href="System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorZoneBase"></xref> class, as long as you do not need to provide zone template support for page developers to add <xref href="System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorPart"></xref> controls to your zone declaratively. In such a case, you would add all <xref href="System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorPart"></xref> controls to a zone programmatically. If you want to provide zone template support, you should inherit from the <xref href="System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorZone"></xref> class.</p>
