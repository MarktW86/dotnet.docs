<p>Character sets include ignorable characters, which are characters that are not considered when performing a linguistic or culture-sensitive sort. In a culture-sensitive search, if <code>value</code> contains an ignorable character, the result is equivalent to searching with that character removed. If <code>value</code> consists only of one or more ignorable characters, the <xref href="System.Globalization.CompareInfo.LastIndexOf(System.String,System.String)"></xref> method always returns <code>source</code>.<xref href="System.String.Length"></xref> â€“ 1, which represents the last index position in <code>source</code>. In the following example, the <xref href="System.Globalization.CompareInfo.LastIndexOf(System.String,System.String)"></xref> method is used to find three substrings (a soft hyphen (U+00AD), a soft hyphen followed by "n", and a soft hyphen followed by "m") in two strings. Only one of the strings contains a soft hyphen. In each case, because the soft hyphen is an ignorable character, the result is the same as if the soft hyphen had not been included in <code>value</code>. When searching for a soft hyphen only, the method returns 6 and 5. These values correspond to the index of the last character in the two strings.
