<p>The only distinction between the <xref href="System.Web.UI.Design.WebControls.PreviewControlDesigner"></xref> class and the <xref href="System.Web.UI.Design.ControlDesigner"></xref> class is that the design host always displays a preview of the control and any modifications that are made in Design view are applied only to the preview of the control. Your code must specifically persist changes to the control.</p>
