<p>Classes that derive from the <xref href="System.Web.UI.WebControls.DataControlField"></xref> class can override this method to indicate whether the controls contained by the field support callbacks. To indicate that callbacks are supported, implement this method as an empty method that does not throw an exception; otherwise, throw an exception with a useful message describing why callbacks are not supported.</p>
