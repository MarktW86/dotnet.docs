<p>In the .NET Framework prior to the [!INCLUDE[net_v20SP1_short](~/includes/net-v20sp1-short-md.md)], regular expressions used in both static and instance method calls were cached. Beginning with the [!INCLUDE[net_v20SP1_short](~/includes/net-v20sp1-short-md.md)], only regular expressions used in static method calls are cached.</p>
