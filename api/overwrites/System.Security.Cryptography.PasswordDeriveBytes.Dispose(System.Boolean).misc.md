<p>
      `Dispose` can be called multiple times by other objects. When overriding `Dispose(Boolean)`, be careful not to reference objects that have been previously disposed in an earlier call to `Dispose`. For more information about how to implement `Dispose(Boolean)`, see [Implementing a Dispose Method](~/docs/standard/garbage-collection/implementing-dispose.md).  
  
 For more information about `Dispose` and `Finalize`, see [Cleaning Up Unmanaged Resources](~/docs/standard/garbage-collection/unmanaged.md).</p>
