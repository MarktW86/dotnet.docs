summary: Writes the specified data, followed by the current line terminator, to the standard output stream.
remarks: The default line terminator is a string whose value is a carriage return followed by a line feed ("\r\n" in C#, or `vbCrLf` in Visual Basic). You can change the line terminator by setting the <xref:System.IO.TextWriter.NewLine%2A?displayProperty=fullName> property of the <xref:System.Console.Out%2A> property to another string.
