<p>This method allows implementers to define processes that must be performed after deleting all the elements from the underlying collection. By defining this method, implementers can add functionality to inherited methods without having to override all other methods.  
  
 <xref href="System.Web.UI.StateManagedCollection.OnClear"></xref> is invoked before the standard `Clear` behavior, whereas <xref href="System.Web.UI.WebControls.ParameterCollection.OnClearComplete"></xref> is invoked after the standard `Clear` behavior.</p>
