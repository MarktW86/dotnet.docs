  > [!NOTE]

  >  <xref:System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates.X509Chain> implements the <xref:System.IDisposable> interface starting with the [!INCLUDE[net_v46](~/includes/net-v46-md.md)]; in previous versions of the .NET Framework, the <xref:System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates.X509Chain> class does not implement this interface, and therefore the `Dispose` method does not exist.
