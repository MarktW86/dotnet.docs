<p>The default action performed by system-provided user interface elements depends on the keyboard state. That is, if a modifier key such as SHIFT, ALT, or CTRL is down (either by a user action or programmatically) when <xref href="System.Windows.Forms.AccessibleObject.DoDefaultAction"></xref> is called, the default action might not be the same as when those keys are not down. Not all objects have a default action.</p>
