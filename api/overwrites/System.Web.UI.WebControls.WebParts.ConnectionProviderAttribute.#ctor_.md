summary: Initializes a new instance of the <xref href="System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.ConnectionProviderAttribute"></xref> class, specifying a value to use for the connection point display name, and optionally specifying values to use for the connection point's ID, the connection point type, or both.
remarks: A provider control can have multiple methods marked with the `ConnectionProviderAttribute` metadata element. In this case, the provider would have multiple connection points, and each instance of the `ConnectionProviderAttribute` element should specify a unique ID value for the associated connection point, so that the provider's connection points can be distinguished.
uid: System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.ConnectionProviderAttribute.#ctor*
