summary: Returns a collection of group objects that specify the groups of which the current principal is a member.
remarks: "This overloaded method only returns the groups of which the principal is directly a member; no recursive searches are performed. Recursive search results are available for user principal objects. For more information, see the <xref:System.DirectoryServices.AccountManagement.UserPrincipal.GetAuthorizationGroups%2A> method.  \n  \n If the principal store is AD DS, the list of groups contains the user's primary group that is identified by the primary group ID attribute in the AD DS object."
