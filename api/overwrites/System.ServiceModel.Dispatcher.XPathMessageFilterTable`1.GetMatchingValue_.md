summary: Returns a value that indicates whether the match criterion of exactly one <xref href="System.ServiceModel.Dispatcher.XPathMessageFilter"></xref> in the table is satisfied by the specified document object and adds the matching filter data to a collection.
remarks: "Use one of these four methods when a single filter is expected to match the document object and only the `FilterData` from the matching filter must be recovered.  \n  \n The first two methods are implementations of <xref:System.ServiceModel.Dispatcher.XPathMessageFilterTable%601.GetMatchingValue%2A>.  \n  \n Use <xref:System.ServiceModel.Dispatcher.XPathMessageFilterTable%601.GetMatchingValue%2A> if the body content does not require examination. Use <xref:System.ServiceModel.Dispatcher.XPathMessageFilterTable%601.GetMatchingValue%2A> if the contents of the message body may require examination.  \n  \n The remaining two methods are overloads specific to <xref:System.ServiceModel.Dispatcher.XPathMessageFilterTable%601>. To filter on a document provided through a navigator, use <xref:System.ServiceModel.Dispatcher.XPathMessageFilterTable%601.GetMatchingValue%2A> or <xref:System.ServiceModel.Dispatcher.XPathMessageFilterTable%601.GetMatchingValue%2A>."
