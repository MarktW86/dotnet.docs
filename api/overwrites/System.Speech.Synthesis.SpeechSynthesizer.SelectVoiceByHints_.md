summary: Selects a voice with specific characteristics.
remarks: "Use the <xref:System.Speech.Synthesis.SpeechSynthesizer.GetInstalledVoices%2A> method and <xref:System.Speech.Synthesis.VoiceInfo> class to obtain the names of installed text-to-speech (TTS) voices that you can select. The <xref:System.Speech.Synthesis.SpeechSynthesizer> object selects the first installed voice that matches the specified characteristics.  \n  \n When an application calls <xref:System.Speech.Synthesis.SpeechSynthesizer.GetInstalledVoices%2A>, the method verifies that each of the voices it finds in the registry meets certain minimum criteria. For any voice that fails verification, <xref:System.Speech.Synthesis.SpeechSynthesizer.GetInstalledVoices%2A> sets its <xref:System.Speech.Synthesis.InstalledVoice.Enabled%2A> property to `False`. An application cannot select a voice whose <xref:System.Speech.Synthesis.InstalledVoice.Enabled%2A> property is `False`. Typically, applications will not set a voiceâ€™s <xref:System.Speech.Synthesis.InstalledVoice.Enabled%2A> property.  \n  \n To select a voice by name, use the <xref:System.Speech.Synthesis.SpeechSynthesizer.SelectVoice%2A> method"
