<p>Internally, the methods of the <xref href="System.Globalization.StringInfo"></xref> class call the methods of the <xref href="System.Globalization.CharUnicodeInfo"></xref> class to determine character categories. Starting with the [!INCLUDE[net_v462](~/includes/net-v462-md.md)], character classification is based on [The Unicode Standard, Version 8.0.0](http://unicode.org/versions/Unicode8.0.0). For the [!INCLUDE[net_v40_long](~/includes/net-v40-long-md.md)] through the [!INCLUDE[net_v461](~/includes/net-v461-md.md)], it is based on [The Unicode Standard, Version 6.3.0](http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode6.3.0/).</p>
