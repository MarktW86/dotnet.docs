<p>If you provide read-only properties in a derived class, be sure to call the <xref href="System.ComponentModel.AsyncCompletedEventArgs.RaiseExceptionIfNecessary"></xref> method. This prevents clients from accessing properties that are potentially not valid due to a failure in the asynchronous operation.</p>
