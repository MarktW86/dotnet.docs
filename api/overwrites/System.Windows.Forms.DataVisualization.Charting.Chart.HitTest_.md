summary: Determines the chart element, if any, that is located at a point defined by the given X and Y coordinates.
remarks: "Call this method to determine the chart element, if any, that is located at a specified point.  \n  \n This method is often used in some mouse-related event—for example, [M:System.Windows.Forms.DataVisualization.Charting.Chart.OnMouseDown(System.Windows.Forms.MouseEventArgs](assetId:///M:System.Windows.Forms.DataVisualization.Charting.Chart.OnMouseDown(System.Windows.Forms.MouseEventArgs?qualifyHint=False&autoUpgrade=True)—to determine which chart element the end-user clicked. The X and Y mouse coordinates obtained from the event parameters are then used for the `x` and `y` parameter values of this method call.  \n  \n The properties of the [HitTestResult](assetId:///T:System.Windows.Forms.DataVisualization.Charting.HitTestResult?qualifyHint=False&autoUpgrade=True) object that is returned can then be used to determine which chart element was clicked; the [HitTestResult](assetId:///T:System.Windows.Forms.DataVisualization.Charting.HitTestResult?qualifyHint=False&autoUpgrade=True) object also provides an instance of the actual object selected, if any."
