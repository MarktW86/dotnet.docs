<p>Developers who need to extend the <xref href="System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager"></xref> control might want to override this method in a derived class. One approach would be to call the base method, and then add some additional custom handling; or you might want to completely customize the process of starting a connection between controls. For example, you might want to verify that certain data is available before creating the connection.</p>
