summary: Initializes a new instance of the <xref href="System.Speech.Recognition.Choices"></xref> class.
remarks: "You can construct a <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.Choices> object using a default constructor (which returns an empty object), from a group of <xref:System.String> objects, or a from set of <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.GrammarBuilder> objects.  \n  \n Because the <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.GrammarBuilder> object supports implicit conversion from <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.SemanticResultValue> and <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.SemanticResultKey>, a <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.Choices> can be constructed from an array of these objects using a cast."
example:
- "The following example uses <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.Choices> objects to create two lists of alternatives.  \n  \n The first <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.Choices> object is constructed from an array of <xref:System.String> objects. The other <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.Choices> object is constructed from an array of <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.GrammarBuilder> objects which have been implicitly converted by a cast.  \n  \n The example uses a <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.GrammarBuilder> object to assemble a phrase, using the <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.Choices> objects and two additional strings, that can be used to recognize speech input in the form of \"Call [contactlList] on [phoneType] phone\" , for example \"Call Jane on cell phone\".  \n  \n```  \npublic GrammarBuilder ChoicesContructor2 ()  \n{  \n    GrammarBuilder gb = new GrammarBuilder ();  \n    Choices phoneType = new Choices (new string[] {\"cell\", \"home\", \"work\"});  \n    Choices contactList = new Choices (new GrammarBuilder[] {(GrammarBuilder) \"Mark\", (GrammarBuilder) \"Jane\", (GrammarBuilder) \"Frank\"});  \n    gb.Append (\"Call\");  \n    gb.Append (contactList);  \n    gb.Append (\"on\");  \n    gb.Append (phoneType);  \n    gb.Append (\"phone\");  \n    return gb;  \n}  \n```"
