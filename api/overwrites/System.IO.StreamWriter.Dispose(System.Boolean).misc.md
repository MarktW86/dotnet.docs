<p>
      `Dispose` can be called multiple times by other objects. When overriding `Dispose`, be careful not to reference objects that have been previously disposed in an earlier call to `Dispose`.  
  
 This method calls the dispose method of the base class, <xref href="System.IO.TextWriter.Dispose(System.Boolean)"></xref>.</p>
