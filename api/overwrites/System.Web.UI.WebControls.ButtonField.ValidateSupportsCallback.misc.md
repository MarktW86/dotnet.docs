<p>Classes that derive from the <xref href="System.Web.UI.WebControls.BoundField"></xref> class can override the <xref href="System.Web.UI.WebControls.ButtonField.ValidateSupportsCallback"></xref> method to indicate whether the controls that are contained by the field support callbacks. To indicate that callbacks are supported, implement the <xref href="System.Web.UI.WebControls.ButtonField.ValidateSupportsCallback"></xref> method as an empty method that does not throw an exception; otherwise, throw an exception with a useful message describing why callbacks are not supported.</p>
