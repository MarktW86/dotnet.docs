<p>The default implementation always returns `null` when <xref href="System.Windows.UIElement.ClipToBounds"></xref> is `false`. Overrides are generally expected to preserve this behavior, although there are exceptions, depending on the relationship and purpose of the derived class and its layout logic as opposed to the base class.</p>
