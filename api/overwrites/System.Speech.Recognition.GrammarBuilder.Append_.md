summary: Appends a grammar element to the current sequence of grammar elements.
remarks: "Use these methods to append grammar elements to an existing <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.GrammarBuilder>. As you create grammar elements, you can append them to the existing builder to progressively develop the constraints for a speech recognition grammar. Each element is added to the end of the current sequence of elements.  \n  \n This method has overloads for appending <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.GrammarBuilder>, <xref:System.String>, <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.Choices>, <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.SemanticResultKey>, and <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.SemanticResultValue> objects.  \n  \n> [!IMPORTANT]\n>  The speech recognizer can throw an exception when using a speech recognition grammar that contains duplicate semantic elements with the same key name or multiple semantic elements that could repeatedly modify the value of the same semantic element. For more information about building a speech recognition grammar that contains semantic information, see [Using SemanticResultKey and SemanticResultValue Objects](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/0fea1236-5261-4608-89b3-9ce9ffc22a1c).  \n  \n For more information about building and using speech recognition grammars, see [Speech Recognition](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/6a7dc524-07fc-4862-8d48-8c10dc64b919) and [Creating GrammarBuilder Grammars](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/7e2cc577-cb05-4318-9da3-7c8675d3d9ae)."
