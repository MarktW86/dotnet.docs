summary: Reinitializes a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) enabled reader to a specified stream or buffer that contains JSON-encoded data.
remarks: "The <xref:System.Xml.XmlDictionaryReader> objects created by one of the <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.Json.JsonReaderWriterFactory.CreateJsonReader%2A> methods implement this interface and are ready to read JSON-encoded data. But if a user wants to reuse the same <xref:System.Xml.XmlDictionaryReader> object to read other JSON-encoded data, then the reader must be initialized to the second dataset to be read by using the one of the <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.Json.IXmlJsonReaderInitializer.SetInput%2A> methods.  \n  \n The <xref:System.Xml.XmlDictionaryReaderQuotas.MaxBytesPerRead%2A> value set as part of the `quotas` parameter only limits the amount of information being read into memory when the input is being read from a stream with the <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.Json.IXmlJsonReaderInitializer.SetInput%28System.IO.Stream%2CSystem.Text.Encoding%2CSystem.Xml.XmlDictionaryReaderQuotas%2CSystem.Xml.OnXmlDictionaryReaderClose%29> method and is not enforced when the <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.Json.IXmlJsonReaderInitializer.SetInput%28System.Byte%5B%5D%2CSystem.Int32%2CSystem.Int32%2CSystem.Text.Encoding%2CSystem.Xml.XmlDictionaryReaderQuotas%2CSystem.Xml.OnXmlDictionaryReaderClose%29> method is used to read information from a buffer. The limits on the number of attributes that can be loaded are not relevant to the JSON context."
