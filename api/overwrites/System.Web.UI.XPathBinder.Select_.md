summary: Uses an XPath data-binding expression at run time to return a list of nodes.
remarks: You can use the overloaded <xref:System.Web.UI.XPathBinder.Select%2A> method declaratively if you want to simplify the retrieval of a set of nodes using an XPath query. To do so, you must place the \<%# and %> tags, which are also used in standard ASP.NET data binding, around the XPath query.
