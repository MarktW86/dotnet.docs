summary: Initiates the set of animations associated with this <xref href="System.Windows.Media.Animation.Storyboard"></xref>.
remarks: "A controllable storyboard can pause, resume, seek, stop, and be removed. To make a storyboard controllable in code, you must use the appropriate overload of the storyboard's <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.Storyboard.Begin%2A> method and specify `true` to make it controllable. For an example, see [How to: Control a Storyboard After It Starts](~/docs/framework/wpf/graphics-multimedia/how-to-control-a-storyboard-after-it-starts.md)."
