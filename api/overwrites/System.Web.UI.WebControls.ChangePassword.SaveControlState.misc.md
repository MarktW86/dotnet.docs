<p>When control state is saved, a string object is returned to the client as a variable that is stored in an HTML <code><input type="hidden" /></code> element. Override the <xref href="System.Web.UI.WebControls.ChangePassword.SaveControlState"></xref> method to extract the state information to use in the <xref href="System.Web.UI.WebControls.ChangePassword"></xref> control.  
  
 Control state is intended for small amounts of critical data, such as a page index or a keyword. Using control state for large amounts of data can adversely affect page performance.</p>
