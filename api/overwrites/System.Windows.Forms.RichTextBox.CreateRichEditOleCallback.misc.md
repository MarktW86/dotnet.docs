<p>You can override this method in your derived class to enable access to the underlying rich-edit features. If you override this method, all drag-and-drop events will not be raised. As a result, you will have to provide your own support for drag-and-drop operations. For more information about the `IRichEditOleCallback` interface, see the Platform SDK documentation at http://msdn.microsoft.com.</p>
