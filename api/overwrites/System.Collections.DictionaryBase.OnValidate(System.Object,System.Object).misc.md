<p>This method allows implementers to define processes that must be performed when executing the standard behavior of the underlying <xref href="System.Collections.Hashtable"></xref>. By defining this method, implementers can add functionality to inherited methods without having to override all other methods.  
  
 <xref href="System.Collections.DictionaryBase.OnValidate(System.Object,System.Object)"></xref> can be used to impose restrictions on the type of objects that are accepted into the collection. The default implementation prevents `null` from being added to or removed from the underlying <xref href="System.Collections.Hashtable"></xref>.</p>
