<p>This method is protected and is designed for use by a .NET Framework data provider.  
  
 If a class that inherits from <xref href="System.Data.Common.DbDataAdapter"></xref> supports batches, that class overrides this method. This method gives the class the opportunity to dispose of any resources allocated to support batching. For example, the class may deallocate the data structure that holds the commands in the batch.</p>
