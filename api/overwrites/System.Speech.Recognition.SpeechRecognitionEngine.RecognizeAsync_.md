summary: Starts an asynchronous speech recognition operation.
remarks: "These methods perform single or multiple, asynchronous recognition operations. The recognizer performs each operation against its loaded and enabled speech recognition grammars.  \n  \n During a call to this method, the recognizer can raise the following events:  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.SpeechRecognitionEngine.SpeechDetected>.  Raised when the recognizer detects input that it can identify as speech.  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.SpeechRecognitionEngine.SpeechHypothesized>.  Raised when input creates an ambiguous match with one of the active grammars.  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.SpeechRecognitionEngine.SpeechRecognitionRejected> or <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.SpeechRecognitionEngine.SpeechRecognized>. Raised when the recognizer finalizes a recognition operation.  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.SpeechRecognitionEngine.RecognizeCompleted>. Raised when a <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.SpeechRecognitionEngine.RecognizeAsync%2A> operation finishes.  \n  \n To retrieve the result of an asynchronous recognition operation, attach an event handler to the recognizer's <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.SpeechRecognitionEngine.SpeechRecognized> event. The recognizer raises this event whenever it successfully completes a synchronous or asynchronous recognition operation. If recognition was not successful, the <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.RecognizeCompletedEventArgs.Result%2A> property on <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.RecognizeCompletedEventArgs> object, which you can access in the handler for the <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.SpeechRecognitionEngine.RecognizeCompleted> event, will be `null`.  \n  \n An asynchronous recognition operation can fail for the following reasons:  \n  \n-   Speech is not detected before the timeout intervals expire for the <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.SpeechRecognitionEngine.BabbleTimeout%2A> or <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.SpeechRecognitionEngine.InitialSilenceTimeout%2A> properties.  \n  \n-   The recognition engine detects speech but finds no matches in any of its loaded and enabled <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.Grammar> objects.  \n  \n-   The <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.SpeechRecognitionEngine> must have at least one <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.Grammar> object loaded before performing recognition. To load a speech recognition grammar, use the <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.SpeechRecognitionEngine.LoadGrammar%2A> or <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.SpeechRecognitionEngine.LoadGrammarAsync%2A> method.  \n  \n-   To modify how the recognizer handles the timing of speech or silence with respect to recognition, use the <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.SpeechRecognitionEngine.BabbleTimeout%2A>, <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.SpeechRecognitionEngine.InitialSilenceTimeout%2A>, <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.SpeechRecognitionEngine.EndSilenceTimeout%2A>, and <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.SpeechRecognitionEngine.EndSilenceTimeoutAmbiguous%2A> properties.  \n  \n-   To perform synchronous recognition, use one of the <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.SpeechRecognitionEngine.Recognize%2A> methods."
