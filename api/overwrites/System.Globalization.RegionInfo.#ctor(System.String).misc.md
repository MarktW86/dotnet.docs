<p>This constructor accepts only specific cultures or country/region codes. However, some neutral culture names are the same as country/region codes. In this case, <code>name</code> is interpreted as a country/region code rather than a neutral culture name, and this constructor does not throw an <xref href="System.ArgumentException"></xref>.</p>
