summary: Determines whether the two specified <xref href="System.Windows.Media.Matrix"></xref> structures have the same values.
remarks: >-
  > [!NOTE]

  >  A <xref:System.Windows.Media.Matrix> stores its values as doubles. Because the value of a <xref:System.Double> can lose precision when arithmetic operations are performed on it, a comparison between two <xref:System.Double> structures that are logically equal might fail.
