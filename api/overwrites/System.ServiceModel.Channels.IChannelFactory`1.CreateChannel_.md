summary: Creates a channel of a specified type to a specified endpoint address.
remarks: Use the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.IChannelFactory%601.CreateChannel%28System.ServiceModel.EndpointAddress%2CSystem.Uri%29> overload to distinguish the address to which the message is initially sent from the ultimate destination when you want to do manual routing. Note that any channels created by this channel factory are closed when the channel factory is closed. For a discussion of addressing, see the [Addresses](~/docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/endpoint-addresses.md) topic.
