<p>
      `Dispose` can be called multiple times by other objects. When you override `Dispose(Boolean)`, be careful not to reference objects that have been previously disposed in an earlier call to `Dispose`. For more information, see [Implementing a Dispose Method](~/docs/standard/garbage-collection/implementing-dispose.md). For more information about `Dispose` and <xref href="System.Object.Finalize"></xref>, see [Cleaning Up Unmanaged Resources](~/docs/standard/garbage-collection/unmanaged.md) and [Overriding the Finalize Method](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/8026cb68-fe93-43fc-96c1-c09ad7d64cd3).</p>
