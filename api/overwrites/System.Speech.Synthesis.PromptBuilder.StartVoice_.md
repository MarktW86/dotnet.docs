summary: Instructs the synthesizer to change the voice in a <xref href="System.Speech.Synthesis.PromptBuilder"></xref> object.
remarks: "A voice represents an installed TTS engine. Use the <xref:System.Speech.Synthesis.SpeechSynthesizer.GetInstalledVoices%2A> methods and <xref:System.Speech.Synthesis.VoiceInfo> class to obtain the names and attributes of installed text-to-speech (TTS) voices that you can select.  \n  \n When an application calls <xref:System.Speech.Synthesis.SpeechSynthesizer.GetInstalledVoices%2A>, the method verifies that each of the voices it finds in the registry meets certain minimum criteria. For any voice that fails verification, <xref:System.Speech.Synthesis.SpeechSynthesizer.GetInstalledVoices%2A> sets its <xref:System.Speech.Synthesis.InstalledVoice.Enabled%2A> property to `False`. An application cannot call any of the <xref:System.Speech.Synthesis.PromptBuilder.StartVoice%2A> methods on a voice whose <xref:System.Speech.Synthesis.InstalledVoice.Enabled%2A> property is `False`. Typically, applications will not set a voiceâ€™s <xref:System.Speech.Synthesis.InstalledVoice.Enabled%2A> property."
