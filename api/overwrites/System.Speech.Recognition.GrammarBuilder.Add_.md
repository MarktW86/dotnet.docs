summary: Creates a new <xref href="System.Speech.Recognition.GrammarBuilder"></xref> that contains a sequence of two grammar elements.
remarks: "The static <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.GrammarBuilder.Add%2A> methods provide another mechanism by which you can combine various types to create diversity and flexibility in grammars built with <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.GrammarBuilder>. These methods correspond to the static <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.GrammarBuilder.op_Addition%2A> methods, which are also defined on the <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.GrammarBuilder> class. The order of the parameters determines the order of the elements in the new <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.GrammarBuilder>.  \n  \n A <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.GrammarBuilder> can also be obtained from <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.Choices>, <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.SemanticResultKey>, <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.SemanticResultValue>, and [String](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=159733) objects. For more information, see the <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.GrammarBuilder.op_Implicit%2A> and <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.GrammarBuilder.op_Addition%2A> operators.  \n  \n> [!IMPORTANT]\n>  The speech recognizer can throw an exception when using a speech recognition grammar that contains duplicate semantic elements with the same key name or multiple semantic elements that could repeatedly modify the value of the same semantic element. For more information about building a speech recognition grammar that contains semantic information, see [Using SemanticResultKey and SemanticResultValue Objects](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/0fea1236-5261-4608-89b3-9ce9ffc22a1c).  \n  \n For more information about building and using speech recognition grammars, see [Speech Recognition](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/6a7dc524-07fc-4862-8d48-8c10dc64b919) and [Creating GrammarBuilder Grammars](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/7e2cc577-cb05-4318-9da3-7c8675d3d9ae)."
