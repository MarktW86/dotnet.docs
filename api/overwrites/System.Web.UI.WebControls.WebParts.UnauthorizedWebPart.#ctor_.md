summary: Initializes property data for a new instance of an <xref href="System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.UnauthorizedWebPart"></xref> control.
remarks: "The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.UnauthorizedWebPart.%23ctor%2A> constructor, in both of its overloads, calls base constructors in the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.ProxyWebPart> class. These constructors each initialize property data and create a new instance of an <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.UnauthorizedWebPart> control.  \n  \n When the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager> control is adding <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> controls (and other server or user controls) to its collection of controls, it checks each control using the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.IsAuthorized%2A> method. If a control instance is not authorized, certain property values from the control (such as its ID) are assigned to properties in a new <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.UnauthorizedWebPart> control, and the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.UnauthorizedWebPart> control is then added to the control tree of the page in place of the control that failed authorization.  \n  \n An <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.UnauthorizedWebPart> control is never rendered in a page, and a user has no way of knowing it is there. However, an <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.UnauthorizedWebPart> control also acts as a placeholder, maintaining the position of the original control in the control tree, and maintaining any preexisting personalization data for the original control. That way, if a user previously personalized a control, it then becomes unauthorized for some reason, and later it is authorized again, the user's personalization data can be restored."
