summary: Updates the value of a setting for the recognizer.
remarks: "Recognizer settings can contain string, 64-bit integer, or memory address data. The following table describes the settings that are defined for a Microsoft Speech API (SAPI)-compliant recognizer. The following settings must have the same range for each recognizer that supports the setting. A SAPI-compliant recognizer is not required to support these settings and can support other settings.  \n  \n|Name|Description|  \n|----------|-----------------|  \n|`ResourceUsage`|Specifies the recognizer's CPU consumption. The range is from 0 to 100. The default value is 50.|  \n|`ResponseSpeed`|Indicates the length of silence at the end of unambiguous input before the speech recognizer completes a recognition operation. The range is from 0 to 10,000 milliseconds (ms). This setting corresponds to the recognizer's <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.SpeechRecognitionEngine.EndSilenceTimeout%2A> property. Default = 150ms.|  \n|`ComplexResponseSpeed`|Indicates the length of silence in milliseconds (ms) at the end of ambiguous input before the speech recognizer completes a recognition operation. The range is from 0 to 10,000ms. This setting corresponds to the recognizer's <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.SpeechRecognitionEngine.EndSilenceTimeoutAmbiguous%2A> property. Default = 500ms.|  \n|`AdaptationOn`|Indicates whether adaptation of the acoustic model is ON (value = `1`) or OFF (value = `0`). The default value is `1` (ON).|  \n|`PersistedBackgroundAdaptation`|Indicates whether background adaptation is ON (value = `1`) or OFF (value = `0`), and persists the setting in the registry. The default value is `1` (ON).|  \n  \n To return one of the recognizer's settings, use the <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.SpeechRecognitionEngine.QueryRecognizerSetting%2A> method.  \n  \n With the exception of `PersistedBackgroundAdaptation`, property values set using the <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.SpeechRecognitionEngine.UpdateRecognizerSetting%2A> methods remain in effect only for the current instance of <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.SpeechRecognitionEngine>, after which they revert to their default settings.  \n  \n You can modify how the speech recognition responds to non-speech input using the <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.SpeechRecognitionEngine.BabbleTimeout%2A>, <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.SpeechRecognitionEngine.InitialSilenceTimeout%2A>, <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.SpeechRecognitionEngine.EndSilenceTimeout%2A>, and <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.SpeechRecognitionEngine.EndSilenceTimeoutAmbiguous%2A> properties."
