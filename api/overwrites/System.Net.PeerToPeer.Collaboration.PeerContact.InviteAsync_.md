summary: Begins an asynchronous invitation operation for an endpoint to join a <xref href="System.Net.PeerToPeer.Collaboration.PeerCollaboration"></xref> application sponsored by the sender of the invitation.
remarks: The caller is not required to sign-in to the <xref:System.Net.PeerToPeer.Collaboration> infrastructure for this method to complete successfully. A <xref:System.Net.PeerToPeer.Collaboration.PeerInvitationResponse> from the invitee is not the same as the invitee accepting the invitation to collaborate. If an invitation is sent to a remote peer that has not installed the application, the invitation is automatically declined.
uid: System.Net.PeerToPeer.Collaboration.PeerContact.InviteAsync*
