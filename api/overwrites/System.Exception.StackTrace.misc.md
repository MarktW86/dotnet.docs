<p>The `StackTrace` property is overridden in classes that require control over the stack trace content or format.  
  
 By default, the stack trace is captured immediately before an exception object is thrown. Use <xref href="System.Environment.StackTrace"></xref> to get stack trace information when no exception is being thrown.</p>
