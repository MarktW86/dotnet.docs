summary: Retrieves the previous sibling of the specified <xref href="System.Windows.Automation.AutomationElement"></xref>.
remarks: "An <xref:System.Windows.Automation.AutomationElement> can have additional sibling elements that do not match the current view condition and thus are not returned when navigating the element tree.  \n  \n The structure of the <xref:System.Windows.Automation.AutomationElement> tree changes as the visible [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_ui](~/includes/tlasharptla-ui-md.md)] elements on the desktop change. It is not guaranteed that an element returned as the previous sibling element will be returned as the previous sibling on subsequent passes."
