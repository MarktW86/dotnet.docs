summary: Releases all resources used by the current instance of the <xref href="System.Runtime.Caching.ChangeMonitor"></xref> class.
remarks: The <xref:System.Runtime.Caching.ChangeMonitor.Dispose%2A> method is used to release the <xref:System.Runtime.Caching.ChangeMonitor> instance and related resources. The public <xref:System.Runtime.Caching.ChangeMonitor.Dispose%2A> method is invoked to coordinate the disposal process with key life-cycle events of derived change-monitor classes (such as initialization), and to release the <xref:System.Runtime.Caching.ChangeMonitor> instance so that the instance can be garbage collected. The <xref:System.Runtime.Caching.ChangeMonitor.Dispose%2A> method is implemented by derived change-monitor classes to dispose of their managed and unmanaged resources.
