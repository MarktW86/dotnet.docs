<p>The derived class must support <xref href="System.Globalization.Calendar.CurrentEra"></xref> when it is passed as the <code>era</code> parameter. One way to support <xref href="System.Globalization.Calendar.CurrentEra"></xref> is by replacing it with the value stored in <code>Eras[0]</code>, which is the value for the current era of the calendar.</p>
