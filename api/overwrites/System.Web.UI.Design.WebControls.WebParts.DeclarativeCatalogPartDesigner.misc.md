<p>The associated control, <xref href="System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.DeclarativeCatalogPart"></xref>, is a `sealed` class and cannot be inherited. Therefore, there is little value in deriving from <xref href="System.Web.UI.Design.WebControls.WebParts.DeclarativeCatalogPartDesigner"></xref> because it cannot be overridden to apply to any other control.</p>
