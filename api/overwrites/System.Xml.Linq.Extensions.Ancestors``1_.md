summary: Returns a collection of elements that contains the ancestors of every node in the source collection.
remarks: "If multiple nodes in the source collection have the same ancestor, the ancestor will be included multiple times in the result collection. To avoid this, use the <xref:System.Linq.Enumerable.Distinct%2A> method.  \n  \n This method uses deferred execution."
