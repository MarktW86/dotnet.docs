<p>Your derived type might be marked as `internal` or `private`, but an instance of your type can be created with the <xref href="System.ComponentModel.TypeDescriptor"></xref> class. Do not write insecure code by assuming the caller is trusted. Assume instead that callers might create instances of your type in partial trust.</p>
