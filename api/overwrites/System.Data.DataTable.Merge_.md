summary: Merge the specified <xref href="System.Data.DataTable"></xref> with the current <xref href="System.Data.DataTable"></xref>.
remarks: "The `Merge` method is used to merge two <xref:System.Data.DataTable> objects that have largely similar schemas. A merge is typically used on a client application to incorporate the latest changes from a data source into an existing <xref:System.Data.DataTable>. This allows the client application to have a refreshed <xref:System.Data.DataTable> with the latest data from the data source.  \n  \n The merge operation takes into account only the original table, and the table to be merged. Child tables are not affected or included. If a table has one or more child tables, defined as part of a relationship, each child table must be merged individually."
example:
- "The following console application demonstrates the behavior of the `missingSchemaAction` parameter of the <xref:System.Data.DataTable.Merge%2A> method. This example creates two versions of the same table, modifying the schema for the second version. The code then attempts to merge the second table into the first.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  This example shows how to use one of the overloaded versions of Merge. For other examples that might be available, see the individual overload topics.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[DataWorks DataTableMergeOverload#1](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_ADO.NET/DataWorks DataTableMergeOverload/CS/source.cs#1)]\n [!code-vb[DataWorks DataTableMergeOverload#1](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_ADO.NET/DataWorks DataTableMergeOverload/VB/source.vb#1)]"
