<p>When you inherit from the <xref href="System.ComponentModel.Design.Serialization.ComponentSerializationService"></xref> class, you must override all the methods in this class. Some of these methods were designed to throw exceptions, as documented in their corresponding topics; it is strongly recommended that derived classes follow these guidelines to maintain consistency of operation. For more information, see the <xref href="System.ComponentModel.Design.Serialization.CodeDomComponentSerializationService"></xref> class.</p>
