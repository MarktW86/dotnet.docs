summary: Creates a symmetric security binding element that is configured to require client authentication based on an issued token and server authentication based on the server certificate.
remarks: "The issued token can have a symmetric or an asymmetric key. The client authenticates the server using the SOAP-level SSL protocol.  \n  \n Both overloads use a <xref:System.ServiceModel.Security.Tokens.IssuedSecurityTokenParameters> parameter. One of them includes a parameter that specifies whether cancellation is required."
