summary: Returns the XML for this streaming element, optionally disabling formatting.
remarks: Note that when debugging a program that uses <xref:System.Xml.Linq.XStreamingElement>, displaying the value of an object causes its <xref:System.Xml.Linq.XStreamingElement.ToString%2A> method to be called. This causes the XML to be serialized. If the semantics of your streaming element query are such that the streaming element can only be streamed once, this may cause undesirable behavior in your debugging experience.
