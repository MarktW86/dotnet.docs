<p>Overriding the <xref href="System.Web.UI.Design.WebControls.BulletedListDesigner.PostFilterEvents(System.Collections.IDictionary)"></xref> method provides a way to change or remove items within the dictionary of events that are exposed by the designer for this control.  
  
 You can directly filter the dictionary that is accessible through the <code>events</code> parameter, or you can leave it unchanged. If you are overriding the <xref href="System.Web.UI.Design.WebControls.BulletedListDesigner.PostFilterEvents(System.Collections.IDictionary)"></xref> method, call the base implementation after you perform your own filtering.</p>
