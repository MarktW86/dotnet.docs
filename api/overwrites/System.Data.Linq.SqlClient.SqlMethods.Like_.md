summary: Determines whether a specific character string matches a specified pattern. This method is currently only supported in LINQ to SQL queries.
remarks: The [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](~/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] `LIKE` functionality cannot be exposed through translation of existing common language runtime (CLR) and .NET Framework constructs, and is unsupported outside of a LINQ to SQL context. The use of this method outside of LINQ to SQL will always throw an exception of type <xref:System.NotSupportedException>.
