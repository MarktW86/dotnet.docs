summary: Compares two vectors for equality.
remarks: A vector's <xref:System.Windows.Vector.X%2A> and <xref:System.Windows.Vector.Y%2A> properties are described using <xref:System.Double> values. Because the value of a <xref:System.Double> can lose precision when arithmetic operations are performed on it, a comparison between two <xref:System.Double> structures that are logically equal might fail.
