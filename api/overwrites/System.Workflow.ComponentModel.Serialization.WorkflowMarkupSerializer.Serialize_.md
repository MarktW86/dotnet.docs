summary: Serializes an <xref href="System.Object"></xref> into extensible Application Markup Language (XAML) format.
remarks: "The functionality of <xref:System.Workflow.ComponentModel.Serialization.WorkflowMarkupSerializer> is dependent on functionality of other types outside of Windows Workflow Foundation. Based on the limitations of those other types, not all data types can be serialized through the <xref:System.Workflow.ComponentModel.Serialization.WorkflowMarkupSerializer>. The following is a list of some unsupported types.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  This is not an exhaustive and complete list of unsupported types.  \n  \n Arrays (supported only if property is decorated with `DesignerSerializationVisibility.Content` attribute value)  \n  \n Parameterless Constructors  \n  \n Multidimensional Arrays  \n  \n Generic types (Generic `List` and `Dictionary` types supported only if property is decorated with `DesignerSerializationVisibility.Content` attribute value)  \n  \n `Hashtable`  \n  \n `Queue`  \n  \n `Stack`  \n  \n `XmlDocument`  \n  \n `MailMessage`  \n  \n `Bitmap`  \n  \n Enumeration Arrays  \n  \n In addition to this list, any property decorated with both the `ContentPropertyAttibute` and the `DesignerSerializationVisibilityAttribute` cannot be serialized by `WorkflowMarkupSerializer`."
