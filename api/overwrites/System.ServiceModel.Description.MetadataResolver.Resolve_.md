summary: Downloads and resolves a metadata address into the <xref href="System.ServiceModel.Description.ServiceEndpoint"></xref> objects for that service.
remarks: "To download metadata but not resolve the information into <xref:System.ServiceModel.Description.ServiceEndpoint> objects, use the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Description.MetadataExchangeClient?displayProperty=fullName> directly.  \n  \n For all synchronous and asynchronous `Resolve` methods, an empty collection is returned if no endpoints were imported or if no endpoints matched the contract. If an empty collection is returned, a warning trace is written."
