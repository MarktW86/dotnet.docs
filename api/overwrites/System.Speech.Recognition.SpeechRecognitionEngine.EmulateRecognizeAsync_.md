summary: Emulates input to the speech recognizer, using text in place of audio for asynchronous speech recognition.
remarks: "These methods bypass the system audio input and provide text to the recognizer as <xref:System.String> objects or as an array of <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.RecognizedWordUnit> objects. This can be helpful when you are testing or debugging an application or grammar. For example, you can use emulation to determine whether a word is in a grammar and what semantics are returned when the word is recognized. Use the <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.SpeechRecognitionEngine.SetInputToNull%2A> method to disable audio input to the speech recognition engine during emulation operations.  \n  \n The speech recognizer raises the <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.SpeechRecognitionEngine.SpeechDetected>, <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.SpeechRecognitionEngine.SpeechHypothesized>, <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.SpeechRecognitionEngine.SpeechRecognitionRejected>, and <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.SpeechRecognitionEngine.SpeechRecognized> events as if the recognition operation is not emulated. When the recognizer completes the asynchronous recognition operation, it raises the <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.SpeechRecognitionEngine.EmulateRecognizeCompleted> event. The recognizer ignores new lines and extra white space and treats punctuation as literal input.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  The <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.RecognitionResult> object generated by the speech recognizer in response to emulated input has a value of `null` for its <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.RecognitionResult.Audio%2A> property.  \n  \n To emulate synchronous recognition, use the <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.SpeechRecognitionEngine.EmulateRecognize%2A> method."
