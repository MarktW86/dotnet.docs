summary: Emulates input to the shared speech recognizer, using text instead of audio for synchronous speech recognition.
remarks: "These methods bypass the system audio input. This can be helpful when you are testing or debugging an application or grammar.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  If Windows Speech Recognition is in the **Sleeping** state, then these methods return `null`.  \n  \n The shared recognizer raises the <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.SpeechRecognizer.SpeechDetected>, <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.SpeechRecognizer.SpeechHypothesized>, <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.SpeechRecognizer.SpeechRecognitionRejected>, and <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.SpeechRecognizer.SpeechRecognized> events as if the recognition operation is not emulated. The recognizer ignores new lines and extra white space and treats punctuation as literal input.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  The <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.RecognitionResult> object generated by the shared recognizer in response to emulated input has a value of `null` for its <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.RecognitionResult.Audio%2A> property.  \n  \n To emulate asynchronous recognition, use the <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.SpeechRecognizer.EmulateRecognizeAsync%2A> method."
