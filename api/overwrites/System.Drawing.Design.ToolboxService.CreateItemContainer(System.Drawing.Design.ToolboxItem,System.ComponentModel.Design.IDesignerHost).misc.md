<p>A linked toolbox item is one whose existence is tied to the storage of a particular designer host. So, in a typical project system, a designer host is associated with a particular file. A toolbox item linked to a designer host would automatically be deleted from the toolbox when the designer hostâ€™s source file is deleted or removed from the project.  
  
 Linked toolbox items make possible scenarios such as disabling the [!INCLUDE[vstecasp](~/includes/vstecasp-md.md)] toolbox items when the Windows Forms designer is open.</p>
