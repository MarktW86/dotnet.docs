summary: Executes a delegate asynchronously on the thread the <xref href="System.Windows.Threading.Dispatcher"></xref> is associated with.
remarks: "In [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](~/includes/tla2sharptla-winclient-md.md)], only the thread that created a <xref:System.Windows.Threading.DispatcherObject> may access that object.  For example, a background thread that is spun off from the main UI thread cannot update the contents of a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Button> that was created on the UI thread.  In order for the background thread to access the Content property of the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Button>, the background thread must delegate the work to the <xref:System.Windows.Threading.Dispatcher> associated with the UI thread.  This is accomplished by using either <xref:System.Windows.Threading.Dispatcher.Invoke%2A> or <xref:System.Windows.Threading.Dispatcher.BeginInvoke%2A>.  <xref:System.Windows.Threading.Dispatcher.Invoke%2A> is synchronous and <xref:System.Windows.Threading.Dispatcher.BeginInvoke%2A> is asynchronous.  The operation is added to the event queue of the <xref:System.Windows.Threading.Dispatcher> at the specified <xref:System.Windows.Threading.DispatcherPriority>.  \n  \n <xref:System.Windows.Threading.Dispatcher.BeginInvoke%2A> is asynchronous; therefore, control returns immediately to the calling object after it is called.  \n  \n <xref:System.Windows.Threading.Dispatcher.BeginInvoke%2A> returns a <xref:System.Windows.Threading.DispatcherOperation> object that can be used to interact with the delegate when the delegate is in the event queue.  \n  \n The <xref:System.Windows.Threading.DispatcherOperation> object returned by <xref:System.Windows.Threading.Dispatcher.BeginInvoke%2A> can be used in several ways to interact with the specified delegate, such as:  \n  \n-   Changing the <xref:System.Windows.Threading.DispatcherPriority> of the delegate as it is pending execution in the event queue.  \n  \n-   Removing the delegate from the event queue.  \n  \n-   Waiting for the delegate to return.  \n  \n-   Obtaining the value that the delegate returns after it is executed.  \n  \n If multiple <xref:System.Windows.Threading.Dispatcher.BeginInvoke%2A> calls are made at the same <xref:System.Windows.Threading.DispatcherPriority>, they will be executed in the order the calls were made.  \n  \n If <xref:System.Windows.Threading.Dispatcher.BeginInvoke%2A> is called on a <xref:System.Windows.Threading.Dispatcher> that has shut down, the status property of the returned <xref:System.Windows.Threading.DispatcherOperation> is set to <xref:System.Windows.Threading.DispatcherOperationStatus.Aborted>."
