summary: Retrieves the <xref href="System.Windows.Media.Animation.Clock.CurrentGlobalSpeed"></xref> of the <xref href="System.Windows.Media.Animation.Clock"></xref> that was created for this <xref href="System.Windows.Media.Animation.Storyboard"></xref>.
remarks: "A clock's <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.Clock.CurrentGlobalSpeed%2A> speed is the rate at which its time is currently progressing, compared to real-world time.  \n  \n To use this method to retrieve information about a storyboard's clock, the storyboard must be controllable. To make a storyboard controllable in code, you must use the appropriate overload of the storyboard's <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.Storyboard.Begin%2A> method and specify `true` to make it controllable. For an example, see [How to: Control a Storyboard After It Starts](~/docs/framework/wpf/graphics-multimedia/how-to-control-a-storyboard-after-it-starts.md)."
