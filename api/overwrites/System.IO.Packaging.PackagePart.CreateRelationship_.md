summary: Creates a part-level relationship between this <xref href="System.IO.Packaging.PackagePart"></xref> to a specified target <xref href="System.IO.Packaging.PackagePart"></xref> or external resource.
remarks: "A part-level relationship defines an association between this part and a target part or resource.  A part-level relationship can be one of two forms.  \n  \n-   Between a source <xref:System.IO.Packaging.PackagePart> to a target <xref:System.IO.Packaging.PackagePart> inside the <xref:System.IO.Packaging.Package>.  \n  \n-   Between a source <xref:System.IO.Packaging.PackagePart> to a target resource outside the package.  \n  \n In a part-relationship the source part is considered the \"owner\" of the relationship.  When the source part is deleted, all the relationships owned by the part are also deleted.  The process of creating or deleting the relationship does not physically alter the target part or resource in any way.  \n  \n The <xref:System.IO.Packaging.PackagePart.CreateRelationship%2A> method does not physically change either the source part, or the target part or resource in any way.  \n  \n The target of a relationship cannot be another relationship.  \n  \n For more information about package relationships see section 1.3 of the *Open Packaging Conventions (OPC)* specification available for download at [http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=71255](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=71255).  \n  \n For more information about XPS documents see the *Open XML Paper Specification (XPS)* available for download at [http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=67000](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=67000)."
