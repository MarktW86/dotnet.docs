<p>The <xref href="System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager"></xref> control is designed to be extended. Because it is so central to Web Parts applications, when you want to extend some specific type or control in the Web Parts control set, in many cases you must also extend the <xref href="System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager"></xref> class, because it is likely to have some property or method that is required to make your custom type work in the context of a Web Parts application. The Web Parts reference documentation (see <xref href="System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts"></xref>), when discussing how to extend a Web Parts type, frequently mentions what needs to be done to extend the <xref href="System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager"></xref> class as well, or shows how to extend it in a code example.</p>
